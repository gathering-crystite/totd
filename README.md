## Synopsis

The Tree of the Day is a webapp where you can upload and rate pictures of trees. 


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I intended to use this site as a project for learning code. I may want to learn AWS Lambda code. I may wat to know how to do something in ansible. I may way to use either AWS or GCP for a back end. I really don't know, yet. Howver, I intend to find out.
