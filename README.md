# Tree Of The Day!

## Synopsis

The Tree of the Day is a webapp where you can upload and rate pictures of trees. 


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

As a kid, my sister, mom, and I would pick out our favorite tree of the day. As we gre older, we'd text these pics to each other. This application will allow us and others to share their favorite tree as well as rate their favorite tree. 

I intended to use this site as a project for learning code. I may want to learn AWS Lambda code. I may wat to know how to do something in ansible. I may way to use either AWS or GCP for a back end. I really don't know, yet. Howver, I intend to find out.
